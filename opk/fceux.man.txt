Auto-resume play
----------------
If enabled, FCEUX will make a special savestate every time you close
ROM (loading another rom or exiting from emulator), and will automatically
load the savestate when you open this ROM next time, so you can continue
from where you left the game.

This savestates will be created in the `$HOME/.fceux/fcs` directory and it
will be named `<filename's game>-resume.fcs`

Cheats
------

*Adapted from FCEUX upstream help*

By default cheat files (.cht) are stored in the "cheats" subdirectory under
the base FCEUX (`$HOME/.fceux/cheats`).

The files are in a simple plain-text format. Each line represents a one-byte
memory patch. The format is as follows(text in brackets [] represents optional
parameters):

    [S][C][:]Address(hex):Value(hex):[Compare value:]Description

Example:

    040e:05:Infinite super power.

A colon(:) near the beginning of the line is used to disable the cheat.
"S" denotes a cheat that is a read-substitute-style cheat(such as with
Game Genie cheats), and a "C" denotes that the cheat has a compare value.


When a game is loaded, FCEUX will load any accompanying saved `.cht` file
in `$HOME/.fceux/cheats` automatically. This can be changed by disabling
Auto load/save in **Cheat browser**.

- Cheat browser -

You can access to Cheat browser from main menu or with hotkey `L1 + RIGHT`.

The Cheat browser will cheat the list of current loaded cheats. It will
display cheat description or code if no description is available.

A `*` in front of chate name will be displayed for enabled cheats. You can
enable/disable a cheat by selecting it and use `A` button.

If there are no loaded cheats for current rom you can import them from
a `.cht` file located in any directory. For import use the `Y` button, it
will init a browser in default ROM folder, navigate to directory where
desired `.cht` file is located and load it using the `A` button. You can
import cheats also from submenu, see below for details.

When a cheat file is imported it will overwrite any cheat previously loaded
and it will be saved in `$HOME/.fceux/cheats` for future auto load/save.

Cheats and auto load/save options can be changed in Cheat browser with
Start and Select buttons respectively. Differently than upstream FCEUX this
options will be saved in the configuration file. Also take into account that
these are global options and not per game options.

With `X` button a submenu is open with different options, some of them for
the selected cheat and other for global operations. From here you can toggle,
delete selected cheat, delete all, import cheats or enable cheats globally and
enable autoload/save cheats.

Game Genie
----------
You must place Game Genie rom in the `$HOME/.fceux` directory and it must
be named `gg.rom`.

You can toggle it in `Settings Menu --> Main Setup` or with the
hotkey `R1 + DOWN`.

When toggled a hard reset will be done if a rom was loaded.

Overclock
----------

*Adapted from FCEUX upstream help*

  - Overclocking (old PPU only)

    Overclocks the console by adding dummy scanlines to the usual PPU loop,
    causing CPU to run more cycles per frame. Can be done in two different
    ways: by adding Post-render scanlines (Before NMI in other emulators)
    and by adding Vblank scanlines (After NMI in other emulators).

    The method to be used depends on the game. Maximum value is 786.

  - Don't overclock 7-bit samples

    Such samples are played by the game at the rate it wants, so by running
    extra cycles, it will generate extra samples. To prevent those from
    being sped up, this option allows to cancel all the dummy scanlines
    once a 7-bit sample starts. This hardly affects gameplay, since such
    samples cause heavy lag, preventing the game from actually operating,
    so disabling overclocking during them won't slow the game down.

  - Notes for Opendingux/RetroFW port

    Overclock is limited to a maximum of 786 scanlines. Taking as reference
    262 scanlines (1 NTSC frame) this is 4x CPU overclock.

    With less power devices, as JZ4760(B), using more than 262 scanlines can
    produce a real slowdown to emulation and framerate.

    - Tipically use is to use Post-render scanlines, but some games need
      VBlank scanlines as Kirby's Adventure or Contra force.
    - The scanlines values to be added depend on the game, but as reference
      1 NTSC frame is chosen (262 scanlines), but also 240 or 260 scanlines
      are typically used.
    - In the overclock settings menu left and right cursors substract or add
      10 scanlines for Post-Render or Vblank options. Maintaining pressed the
      `A` button the step value will be 1 scanline and maintaining pressed
      the `Y` button the step value will be 262 scanlines.

What's new
----------

 30 August 2023
  - Updated to upstream 2.6.6

 18 February 2022
  - Updated to upstream 2.6.2
  - Change video mode to 320x240 when access cheats with hotkey
  - Added Pixel Aspect Ratio for hardware scaling: 1:1, 8:7, 4:3
  - Added configuration to change NTSC start & end scanlines.
  - Added L hotkeys:
    - L + A Turbo mode
    - L + B Clip top/bottom (8 pixels each)
    - L + X Change Pixel Aspect Ratio
    - L + Y Clip sides (8 pixels each side)
  - Matched throttle and sound implementations with the upstream Qt/SDL driver.
  - Added Integer Frame Rate option to better sync video with the video display
    refresh.
  - Added sound Buffer size option. It is expressed in ms. Default value is 128
    and the valid values range is from 15 to 200.
  - Enabled Frameskip configuration with levels Auto and from 0 to 11. Default
    level is 0.
  - This changes have impact in previously configured games so you must revise
    its configurations:
    - FPS throttle 'Off' previously implements an implicit frameskip based on
      sound buffer. Now this frameskip is configured by setting the option
      Frameskip to 'Auto'.
    - FPS throttle 'On' now uses nanosleep to sync the game to the intended
      framerate.
    - The Frameskip levels (0-11) are done via a framekip table, the upstream
      FCEUX frameskipping is very aggresive. The frameskip table is borrowed
      from mame084 source so the thanks goes to MAME dev team.
    - Sound Buffer size is defaulted to 128 ms. Previous builds have 30 ms as
      default value.
  - Included upstream palette files in the opk file.
  - Rearranged config menu:
    - Add Palette settings submenu.
    - Move custom palette and NTSC Palette control to Palette settings menu.
    - Add Force Grayscale and De-emphasis Bit Swap options to Palette menu.
    - Add hotkey L1 + UP to toggle de-emphasis bit swap.
    - In Palette settings Custom palette search first for palette files in the
      `palettes` directory distributed with the opk. You can navigate to other
      directories, use the B button to go up in directory structure and A button
      to enter in a directory.
    - In Palette settings use the Left cursor to clean custom palette.
  - Added video filter option for hardware scaler. 
    - Only for OpenDingux (JZ47xx and JZ46xx). 
    - Add hotkey L + LEFT/RIGHT to decrease/increase the filter value (0-32). 
    - Values: 0 = Nearest, 1 = Bilinear, 2-32 = Bicubic.

 25 September 2021
  - Merged asoderq/sydarn2 overclocking work. As upstream it only works with
    Old PPU.
    (See https://github.com/asoderq/fceux-for-retrogame/releases/tag/2021-09-11)
  - Added submenu in cheat browser with some new actions (delete cheat, delete
    all cheats) and other already existing options
  - Fixed enabling Scanline start and end when loading a rom.
    For this FCEUD_ReloadConfig is refactored to call UpdateEMUCore, also
    moving enabling autoresume to UpdateEMUCore.
  - Build for OpenDingux for lepus.
  - Fix video region autoset after last refactorings.
  - Merge latest commits from upstream.
  - For RetroFW and Lepus OD PGO builds has been used.
 
 25 July 2021
  - Some refactorings for Game Genie use and assign hotkey to toggle it.
  - Added autoresume. It can be enabled in `Main settings`. This is a feature
    from upstream FCEUX.
  - Added Cheat browser. With it you can import cheats from `.cht` files, that
    will be saved in `$HOME/.fceux/cheats` for later autoload, and
    enable/disable loaded cheats.
    Also you can enable/disable cheats and enable/disable the auto load/save
    of cheats files per game globally, both are by default enabled.

 21 July 2021
  - The screenshot menu option now saves directly when the A button is pressed.
    Until now you had to press the A button and then exit from menu to emulator
    for the screenshot to be saved.
    Screenshots are saved at `$HOME/.fceux/snaps` directory. Filenames follow
    the scheme `<rom name>-<sequential number>.png`.
  - Fixed a bug in the automatic video region change that caused the save
    settings per game to not work.
  - RetroFW: Add Start+Select combo to open menu. Configurable in Control
    option. (taken from pingflood's RetroFW port).
  - RetroFW. Add ipk build for RetroFW 1 devices.
  - OpenDingux: For hardware scaling in OpenDingux 2014 versions (stock
    firmware or Rogue), the full screen is forced by disabling the aspect ratio
  - Add manual to opk/ipk and updated the Readme.

 10 July 2021
  - Based on soarqin's fork and upgraded to upstream FCEUX 2.4.0 version with
    additions from gameblabla and pingflood's versions.
  - Changes to Makefile for beta OD and RetroFW 2 compilation
  - Fixed the exit from main menu
  - Load rom: pagination with left and right cursors changed to scroll
    one page
  - For OpenDingux beta: Set video refresh rate based on cartridge region
    (taken from gameblabla's port)
  - Automatically set video mode based on cartridge region
  - Fixed the Flip disc option from main menu option
  - Enable Flip disc option in main menu only if a FDS file is inserted
    (taken from pingflood's RetroFW port)
  - Try to load disksys.rom from current rom directory
    (taken from pingflood's RetroFW port)
  - For debug purposes: when launch FCEUX witouth cartridge launch
    emulator rom selector
  - Change button layout in Control Setup
  - Some other minor changes

Build
-----
Use 'make' to compile. If your toolchain is not in /opt/gcw0-toolchain
pass your path in the variable TOOLCHAIN.
Executable and opk files can be named with TARGET variable. By default the name
is 'fuse_od'. Upstream version and build date will be added to opk name.
For 2014 OpenDingux (Stock firmware o Rogue) pass the variable ODVERSION=2014
To compile for RetroFW pass 'retrofw' to DEVICE variable. For RetroFW opk
and ipk files will be created.

Examples:
make TOOLCHAIN=/opt/retrofw2-toolchain TARGET=fceux_retrofw DEVICE=retrofw -f Makefile
make TOOLCHAIN=/opt/opendingux-toolchain TARGET=fceux_od_beta -f Makefile
make TOOLCHAIN=/opt/gcw0-toolchain TARGET=fceux_gcw0 ODVERSION=2014 -f Makefile
make TOOLCHAIN=/opt/lepus-toolchain TARGET=fceux_lepus DEVICE=lepus -f Makefile

Build files are created in the `bin`directory.

Thanks go to current maintainers of upstream FCEUX and all people who worked on
each incarnation of FCEUX: the_gama, ValdikSS and DiegoSLTS, Steward-fu, soarqin,
gameblabla, pingflood.
